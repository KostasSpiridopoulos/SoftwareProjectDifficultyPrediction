# SoftwareProjectDifficultyPrediction
In this project, i am using several ml algorithm both for regression and classification to predict the difficulty of a software project. 

# Regression
In this part i am using 3 machine learning algorithms. For each of them i am tuning the model and evaluating the results. The code is accompanied by comments with explanations
First Algorithm is Gam for which i am trying numerous architectures with different levels of flexibility. Second is knn-regression also with tunning of the hyperparameter. The last one is decision tree boosting with tunning of many haperparameters and evaluation of the results.

# Classification

In this part i devide data into 2 classes "high" and "low" difficulty of the software project. So, basically is binary classication tasks. Like in regression part this is accompanied by by comments with explanations. First algorithm is classic logistic regression for which i am performing feature selection and trying different thresholds. Second one is SVM for which i execute numerous tunings of hyperparameters such as kernels and gamma. The last one for classification is lda and i compare it with qda to see if more flexible algorithm wll perform better.


#For both tasks you can find code for visualization of the results. In classification you also can find a lot of feature selections tasks.
